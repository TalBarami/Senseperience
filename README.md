# Sensperience
Sensperience is a virtual reality software application which allows the user to experience a different view of the world.
We’ve created a holistic custom experience that can be fully simulated and controlled by the developer.

We performed in the “Dialogue in the Dark” exhibition in the “Israel Children’s Museum”. They let their visitors experience a life with visual impairments.

Our project use advance technological hardware in order to give the user a different experience, using a technological point of view.
The project is based on the interaction between the graphical environments we create and the human ability to see, hear and feel.

During the development process we focused on creating an integrated system between Geomagic Touch Haptic Device and the Oculus Rift VR Headset using the Unity Game Engine.
Each scene is a different room or environment, containing objects from a variety of materials and textures.
The user can explore the scenes, travel between them and interact with the objects.
